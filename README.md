### Jest Another RPG

## Description
A simple, text-based RPG created as an introduction to Node.js, test-driven development, and object-oriented programming. A command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which the user battles a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion. The game creates new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, and also implements basic code tests using the Jest framework.
